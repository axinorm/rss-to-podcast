Okay, here's a detailed extract of the article, designed for engaging audio narration.

"Staying current with technology is a constant challenge for developers, and I’m a firm believer in the power of podcasts as a way to absorb information effectively. I can listen while commuting, at the beach, or at the gym – it’s incredibly convenient. That realization sparked an idea: transforming RSS feeds into podcasts using local AI, specifically leveraging the capabilities of Apple Silicon chips. This project, designed for summer, focuses on macOS as the primary platform, though adjustments might be needed for other operating systems.

My approach involves scripting, primarily using Python, a language I’m comfortable with. What’s particularly exciting is the integration of three Artificial Intelligence engines, which contributed roughly 80% of the code. The core goal is to maintain local processing, avoiding reliance on proprietary solutions. To achieve this, I’m utilizing two key tools: Ollama and mlx-audio.

Ollama is an open-source tool that simplifies the deployment and use of large language models, or LLMs, on personal machines. It provides an API, but also offers graphical interfaces like open-webui or Ollamacif you prefer. The role of Ollama is crucial because blog posts are written for reading, not listening. The script sends the raw text to the LLM with a specific prompt, essentially acting as an "audio content producer." It also translates the content into English, the default language for the audio interpreter.

Then comes mlx-audio, a Python library specializing in audio processing, designed to take full advantage of Apple Silicon architecture. It converts the text generated by the LLM into an audio waveform, saving it as a .wav file. A variety of text-to-speech, or TTS, models are available, and I’m using the default ones for simplicity.

This combination of Ollama for content processing and mlx-audio for voice generation creates a fully automated, locally-hosted podcast production workflow. The code repository is available for anyone wanting to give it a try. The magic command to initiate the process requires the RSS feed URL and site name as parameters, with further details available in the documentation. Imagine listening to your own articles as a podcast – it’s a fantastic way to repurpose content!

While a few adjustments might be needed for customization, such as adding new languages or varying voices, the initial version is functional and ready to use. Feel free to experiment with the code, fork it, and make it your own. This project offers a unique and efficient way to transform your favorite RSS feeds into engaging audio experiences, perfect for a summer filled with podcasts."
